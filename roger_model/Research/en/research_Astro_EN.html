      In recent years, different trends in space development are occurring. From one side, there is
      a push for re-usability and to design systems that enable repeatable access to space. On the
      other side, there have been numerous one-off missions, as
      well as closely related missions (Hayabusa and Hayabusa 2) to various celestial bodies. With the
      expansion of these trends and the developing of newer missions (OKEANOS, DESTINY +), the
      question about a low-cost recurring architecture for deep space exploration missions and its possible
      benefits arises.
      The main design focus is the location of a Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle (DS-OTV) in the
      Earth’s vicinity that would allow exploration missions to rendezvous and dock with it, re-fuel, and
      continue towards their main objective, including a possible Earth swing-by. This architecture can
      benefit from lower mass at launch for the successive missions, allowing for smaller and lower-cost
      launchers like the Epsilon or the future H3 to be used, higher availability of launch windows and
      flexibility against delays and unforeseen circumstances. The design of its parking orbit is crucial,
      as it needs to be accessible while keeping low stationkeeping costs. A preliminary analysis on the
      characteristics and feasibility of the candidate orbit families in the Sun-(Earth+Moon) system is
      carried out in this investigation.

      Lagrange point orbits have long been considered for similar purposes and have been extensively
      studied in the literature. Of special interest are orbits around points L<sub>1,2</sub> and the transfers
      between them, as their topological structure allows for the existence of stable/unstable manifolds
      emanating from them that can be used for transfer trajectories. These include planar and vertical
      Lyapunov, Halo and Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHO). Other orbits centered in the smaller
      primary of the system (Earth), such as Distant Retrograde Orbits (DRO), Low Prograde Orbits 
      and other bifurcation families from them are also interesting as intermediate trajectories.
      The study consists of the generation of period orbit families of interest in the Sun-(Earth+Moon)
      CR3BP system by numerical methods such as pseudo-arclength continuation and the classification
      of the orbits and families with respect to the period, stability, geometry and energy level with the
      aid of classical dynamical system tools. First, a stability-energy plot that condenses all the previ-
      ous properties is presented. Here, promising orbits in similar levels of energy can be singled out
      from their families. Low-energy and impulsive transfer maneuvers are designed between promising
      members of the families by a search of possible intersection of the stable/unstable manifolds of the orbits. 
      From selected orbit combinations, useful resonant orbit pairs or groups will be generated on
      the basis of maximizing rendezvous opportunities between the DS-OTV and the exploration space-
      craft. A similar framework is used for the design of the transfer trajectories leaving the parking
      orbit. Emphasis is placed in the creation of chains of orbits that allow the DS-OTV to adapt to the
      different requirements of successive missions, including energy levels at launch and at the objec-
      tive, time-of-flight, and fuel consumption. Finally, an on-orbit re-fueling architecture is proposed
      incorporating the different elements previously studied, and an estimation of the feasibility of the
      project is carried out.

      In recent years, different trends in space development are occurring. From one side, there is
a push for re-usability and to design systems that enable repeatable access to space. 1–3 On the
other side, there have been numerous one-off missions (Rosetta, OSIRIS-Rex, IKAROS), as
well as closely related missions (Hayabusa and Hayabusa 2 ) to various celestial bodies. With the
expansion of these trends and the developing of newer missions (OKEANOS, DESTINY +), the
question about a low-cost recurring architecture for deep space exploration missions and its possible

The main design focus is the location of a Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle (DS-OTV) in the

and lower-cost launchers like the Epsilon or the future H3 to be used, higher availability of launch
windows and flexibility against delays and unforeseen circumstances. The design of its parking
orbit is crucial, as it needs to be accessible while keeping low stationkeeping costs.
Lagrange or Libration point orbits have long been considered for similar purposes and have been
extensively studied in the literature. Of special interest are orbits around points L<sub>1,2</sub> and the
transfers between them, as their topological structure allows for the existence of stable/unstable
manifolds emanating from them that can be used for transfer trajectories. These include planar and

energy plot that condenses information about energy level, stability and geometry is presented,
where the candidate orbits in similar energy levels are picked from their families. Low-energy and

sections of the stable/unstable manifolds of the orbits. From selected orbit combinations, useful
resonant orbit pairs or groups will be generated on the basis of maximizing rendezvous opportu-
nities between the DS-OTV and the exploration spacecraft. A similar framework is used for the
design of the transfer trajectories leaving the parking orbit. Fuel consumption of the manoeuvers
is also taken into account. Finally, an on-orbit re-fueling architecture is proposed incorporating the
different elements previously studied, and an estimation of the feasibility of the project is carried
out.

The Kawaguchi Laboratory, located on the ISAS / JAXA campus, welcomes active students from all over the world.

Focusing on guidance, navigation and control of space systems, we are developing advanced space technologies. At Kawaguchi Lab, students are not only able to study mission-oriented research topics, but also to join large-scale space projects organized by ISAS & JSPEC / JAXA. Our research programs are supervised by Professor Jun’ichiro Kawaguchi and world-class researchers.

We study varieties of mission-oriented topics such as spacecraft astrodynamics, solar sail dynamics, spacecraft guidance, navigation and control, and planetary science. Another unique feature at Kawaguchi Lab is that we have also a lot of opportunities to test our results in real conditions; thus, we can learn not only from theoretical analysis but also have chances to experiment.

We are currently involved in the solar power sail demonstration project IKAROS (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun), which uses Sun light to generate electrical power and accelerate. Kawaguchi Laboratory has had a center role in creating the technology of the propulsion system. Moreover, we contribute to proposing new ideas about structure and materials for the spacecraft.
